    "## **Introduction and Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, data-driven decision-making has become crucial across industries. Despite the growing reliance on data, effectively retrieving information from databases remains challenging for non-technical stakeholders. Typically, databases rely on Structured Query Language (SQL) for data retrieval—often a barrier for users unfamiliar with SQL syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bridge this gap, the task of **\"Text-to-SQL generation\"** has emerged, focusing on automatically converting natural language (English) queries into accurate SQL statements. A successful Text-to-SQL system can significantly improve accessibility to complex data insights, empowering business analysts, product managers, and executives to directly query databases without relying on engineering resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Objective and Use Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to build, evaluate, and deploy a high-quality Text-to-SQL model. Our specific use case targets business queries posed by non-technical users, converting them into executable SQL queries tailored for popular databases like **MySQL and SparkSQL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Query:**  \n",
    "  `\"List all customers who spent more than $5000 in 2024*`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatically Generated SQL Query:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT customer_name, SUM(amount_spent) as total_spent\n",
    "FROM transactions\n",
    "WHERE YEAR(transaction_date) = 2024\n",
    "GROUP BY customer_name\n",
    "HAVING total_spent > 5000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Dataset and Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To objectively measure performance and ensure rigorous benchmarking, this project leverages the [**Spider dataset**](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider/) ( [Yu et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08887)) , widely regarded as the gold standard for Text-to-SQL research. This dataset provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diverse and complex natural language queries.\n",
    "- Corresponding SQL statements spanning multiple database schemas.\n",
    "- A rigorous framework to evaluate model accuracy, including **Exact Match (EM)** and **execution accuracy** metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Approach and Methodology\n",
